## üöÄ Deployed Application

Frontend: [https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app](https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app)  
Backend: `<https://insyd-backend-m2lb.onrender.com/notifications/{userId}>`



---

## üìå How to Use

### 1. View Notifications of a User
Each user can view their notifications by visiting:

https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app/?userId={userId}


For example:
- **Alice (User 1):** https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app/?userId=1  
- **Bob (User 2):** https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app/?userId=2  
- **Charlie (User 3):** https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app/?userId=3  

üëâ You can also try **any other `userId` (e.g., 4, 5, 10, etc.)** ‚Äî the app won‚Äôt throw an error because of the database seeding logic.  
If the user doesn‚Äôt exist, the app will still work but simply show no notifications.

If you don‚Äôt provide a `userId`, it defaults to **Alice (1)**.

### 2. Send a New Notification
1. Click on the **"Send Notification"** button (form will expand).  
2. Select:
   - **Action type** (Follow / Like / Comment)  
   - **Target user** (the recipient of the action)  
3. Click **Submit**.  
4. The notification will appear in the target user‚Äôs notification list.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:  
- A user **cannot follow themselves**, but they can like or comment on their own posts.  
- Notifications refresh automatically every 5 seconds.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** ReactJS  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database:** SQLite (seeded with 3 sample users: Alice, Bob, Charlie)  

---

## üß™ Example Test Flow
1. Open [https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app/?userId=1](https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app/?userId=1) ‚Üí view Alice‚Äôs notifications.  
2. Send a **Follow** notification from Alice to Bob.  
3. Open [https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app/?userId=2](https://insyd-notifcation.netlify.app/?userId=2) ‚Üí see Bob‚Äôs notification.  
4. Try with any other `userId` (e.g., `?userId=10`) ‚Üí works fine, will just show an empty notification list until you send something to that user.

## üìå Limitations
- No authentication  
- No real-time WebSockets (only polling every 5 seconds)  
- SQLite is used for demo only

## ‚ú® Future Improvements
- Real-time notifications with WebSockets  
- Authentication & user sessions  
- Richer UI/UX
